# Refresh the gpg-agent tty before ssh-ing somewhere from a terminal.  (Most
# online sources run the gpg-connect-agent command directly here, once at the
# beginning of each login, but that doesn't work for long-running tmux
# sessions.)
#
# NOTE: To use this, you'll probably want to alias ssh to refresh-agent-and-ssh,
# as follows, in your .bashrc or .zshrc:
#
#     alias ssh=refresh-agent-and-ssh
#
# You'll also want to set various environment variables (like $SSH and $GIT_SSH)
# to tell other commands to use this wrapper instead of calling /usr/bin/ssh
# directly.
